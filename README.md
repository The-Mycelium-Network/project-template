# The Mycelium Network Project Template Repository

This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for our community projects. It can be used either to start a new project or just to grab particular files.

This project template repository is based on the [template repository](https://github.com/cncf/project-template) by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://github.com/cncf).

## Instructions

Creating a repository from a template is a great way to start a new project quickly. You just have to click on the `Use this template` button above the file list, and then follow the given instructions. With the repo created, customize every template and address each TODO item.

## Configure actions

For the `auto-merge` workflow, you need to add a personal access token to the repository. For more details, see the [documentation for the action](https://github.com/project-calavera/calavera-reusable-actions#auto-merge).
